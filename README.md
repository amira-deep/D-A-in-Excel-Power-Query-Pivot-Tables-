  Executive summary

Here are the tables we used to conduct our analysis
•	Orders Table
•	Return Table
•	Shipping Cost Table
•	People Table

The Analysis
     Customer loyalty
   What is the most used ship mode by our customers?
                                                              
Based on the table above we counted the number of times each shipping mode occurred in the orders table
And we found that the standard class shipping mode was the most one used by our customers.
Recommendation:
*We should focus more promotions on the standard shipping mode as it the most used.
*We should find ways to reduce the cost of the standard shipping mode and make sure it’s profitable as it is the most used shipping mode.
*Same Day shipping mode was the least used shipping mode which might be better to revise the cost and possible scenarios where it might be removed.
